### **ðŸ“Š Key Insights**
- **Profit is growing but volatile** â€“ Annual profit grew +12.7% YoY to $92.4K, yet monthly trends show sharp fluctuations, highlighting underlying instability.
- **Technology drives profit** â€“ Copiers and Phones are strong contributors, while Furniture consistently underperforms, dragging overall margin.
- **Consumer segment leads, regions diverge** â€“ Consumers deliver the strongest profit, with West/East regions contributing ~80% of total, while South and Central lag.
- **Discounts underperform overall** â€“ ROI of discounts per $1 is negative at the aggregate level, meaning promotions are eroding more margin than they generate.
- **ROI varies sharply by sub-category** â€“ Labels ($7.44), Paper, and Envelopes show positive ROI, while Furniture (Tables â€“$1.40, Bookcases) destroys value.

<br>

### **âœ… Recommendations**
- **Stabilize profit base** â€“ Tighten monitoring of volatile months and apply guardrails on high-risk products/regions to smooth fluctuations.
- **Double down on Technology winners** â€“ Expand profitable categories (Copiers, Phones), supported by focused marketing and inventory investment.
- **Address underperformers** â€“ Reassess Furniture discounts and Central/South region strategy to stop consistent losses.
- **Redesign discount strategy** â€“ Stop treating promotions as a blanket growth lever; adopt targeted, ROI-driven discounting.
- **Scale profitable subs, cut value traps** â€“ Protect/expand Office Supplies ROI leaders (Labels, Paper, Envelopes), while eliminating or restructuring Furniture discounts.
