# Superstore Dashboard

## **US Superstore Dashboard**
**üìå Background & Objectives**

You, the COO of Superstore, asked me, a data analyst, to design a monitoring dashboard to answer one critical question:

  ‚ÄúHow is the business performing in terms of growth and profitability, and where are the biggest opportunities or risks?‚Äù

To address this issue, I developed a dashboard that delivers:
1.	**Executive Performance Monitoring** ‚Äì At-a-glance KPIs on Orders, Sales, Profit, and Profit Margin, with year-over-year comparisons.
2.	**Exploratory Insights for Strategy** ‚Äì Drill-down views into Category, Segment, and Region performance, enabling leadership to identify drivers of growth, unprofitable areas, and operational inefficiencies.

But the original question was quite broad. After a discussion with you, we narrowed the scope into five major questions that this dashboard helps answer.

**üîç The Five Key Questions**

1.	Are we growing profitably year-over-year, or are rising sales masking margin erosion?
2.	Which categories and sub-categories of product are strengthening our bottom line, and which are consistently dragging it down?
3.	Why did we see sharp spikes or drops in profit during certain months ‚Äî and what drove those changes?
4.	Which customer segments deliver the healthiest profit margins, and are we investing in the right ones?
5.	Why do some regions show strong sales but weak profits ‚Äî what‚Äôs causing the gap?
