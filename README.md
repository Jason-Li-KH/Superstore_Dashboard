# Superstore Dashboard

## **US Superstore Dashboard**
**üìå Background & Objectives**

You, the COO of Superstore, asked me, a data analyst, to design a monitoring dashboard to answer one critical question:

  ‚ÄúHow is the business performing in terms of growth and profitability, and where are the biggest opportunities or risks?‚Äù

To address this issue, I developed a dashboard that delivers:
1.	**Executive Performance Monitoring** ‚Äì At-a-glance KPIs on Orders, Sales, Profit, and Profit Margin, with year-over-year comparisons.
2.	**Exploratory Insights for Strategy** ‚Äì Drill-down views into Category, Segment, and Region performance, enabling leadership to identify drivers of growth, unprofitable areas, and operational inefficiencies.

But the original question was quite broad. After a discussion with you, we narrowed the scope into five major questions that this dashboard helps answer.

**üîç The Five Key Questions**

1.	What is our overall profit trend compared to last year?
2.	Which product categories and sub-categories generate the most profit, and which consistently lose money?
3.	Why did profits spike in some months and drop sharply in others?
4.	Which customer segments contribute the most to profit?
5.	Why are some regions profitable while others generate losses despite strong sales?
