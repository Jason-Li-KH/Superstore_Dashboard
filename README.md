# **📌 Executive Summary of Insights**
- **Profit is growing steadily year-over-year (+12.7% in 2017)**, but volatility within months reveals unstable performance across products, regions, and segments.
- **Profitability is highly concentrated** — Technology (Copiers, Phones), the Consumer segment, and East/West regions drive gains, while Furniture, Corporate/Home Office, and Central/South drag results.
- **Discounting is destroying value overall** — ROI per $1 of discount remains negative, with Furniture discounts especially unprofitable; only select Office Supplies categories generate positive, efficient returns.
- **Sustainable growth requires shifting strategy** — move away from blanket discounts, double down on high-performing products/regions, and adopt value-based pricing to stabilize margins and scale profitability.

## **📌 Background**

As the COO of Superstore, you wanted to optimize profitability while reducing losses across the business. You tasked me, a data analyst, with designing a monitoring dashboard to track business health and answer one critical question:

  “How is the business performing in terms of growth and profitability, and where are the biggest opportunities or risks?”

<br>

## **🎯 Objective**

To address this issue, I developed a dashboard that delivers:
1.	**Executive Performance Monitoring** – At-a-glance KPIs on Orders, Sales, Profit, and Profit Margin, with year-over-year comparisons.
2.	**Exploratory Insights for Strategy** – Drill-down views into Category, Segment, and Region performance, enabling leadership to identify drivers of growth, unprofitable areas, and operational inefficiencies.

<br>

## **📊 Key KPIs**

The dashboard can be viewed in two KPIs:
1. **Profit**: A clear, comprehensive measure of business performance that reflects the net outcome of all operational and strategic decisions.
2. **Discount ROI**: Since discounting is a core part of Superstore’s sales strategy, we measure its return per $1 invested in discounting to evaluate whether discounts actually generate profit or erode margins.
 
<br>

## **🔍 The Four Key Questions**

The overall guiding question is narrowed down to four major questions:
1.	How is profit changing over time, and are we sustaining growth year over year?
2.	Which product, customer segement, and region generate the most profit, and which consistently lose money?
3.	Are discounts and pricing strategies helping us grow profitably, or are they driving margin erosion?
4.  Given these insights, where should the company focus its resources to maximize overall profitability?

**📊 Key Insights**
- **Steady Growth of Profit:** Profit has grown consistently year after year, reaching $92.4K in 2017, with +12.7% growth compared to 2016. This indicates a healthy topline expansion.
- **High Volatility Within Years:** Despite annual growth, monthly profit trends reveal sharp fluctuations, with frequent spikes and dips. This suggests instability in profitability at a more granular level. 
- **Volatility Across Dimensions:** Profit swings are concentrated in specific areas — Technology (Copiers, Machines), certain regions (Central, West), and segments (Corporate, Home Office).

<br>

**✅ Recommendation**
- Dive deeper into the underlying factor of fluctuations.
- Prioritize stabilizing volatility by tightening controls on high-risk products, regions, and segments to sustain consistent profit growth.

**📊 Key Insights**
- **Overall ROI is negative and declining**: Across all years, the ROI of discounts per $1 remains below break-even, indicating that discounts are not translating into profitable returns at the company level.
- **Category-level performance is highly uneven**: Office Supplies shows modest positive ROI, while Furniture consistently destroys value and Technology remains volatile, highlighting the lack of uniform impact.
- **Furniture discounts are a major drag**: Sub-categories like Tables (-$1.40) and Bookcases show strong negative ROI, suggesting that discounts in Furniture should be minimized or restructured.
- **Office Supplies lead discount efficiency**: Sub-categories such as Labels ($7.44), Paper, and Envelopes demonstrate that discounts can work — but only in selective, low-cost product lines where price sensitivity drives volume.

<br>

**✅ Recommendation**
- **Reassess overall discount strategy**: Since aggregate ROI is consistently negative, discounts should no longer be treated as a broad growth lever. Management should adopt a more surgical, evidence-based approach.
- **Phase out Furniture discounting**: Discounts in Furniture (especially Tables and Bookcases) are destroying value. Either eliminate discounts in this category or shift to value-based promotions (bundling, financing, or service add-ons).
- **Double down on Office Supplies**: Sub-categories like Labels, Paper, and Envelopes deliver positive ROI. Discounts here should be protected and potentially expanded, as they drive profitable volume in price-sensitive items.
- **Pilot targeted Technology promotions**: Technology shows mixed performance. Instead of blanket discounting, run A/B tests at the product level (e.g., Accessories vs. Machines) to isolate where discounts trigger incremental, profitable demand.

<br>

### **❓ Question 4: Given these insights, where should the company focus its resources to maximize overall profitability?**

**📊 Key Insights**
- **Profitable Growth Needs Stability**: While profit has grown steadily overall, the sharp month-to-month volatility and concentrated risks in specific categories, segments, and regions threaten long-term sustainability.
- **Structural Weaknesses Remain**: Furniture consistently drags down performance, discounts erode value at the aggregate level, and regional/segment imbalances indicate inefficiencies that must be addressed.
- **Discounts Can Work — If Targeted**: Evidence shows that broad discounting destroys value, but selective promotions in Office Supplies (e.g., Labels, Paper) and parts of Technology can generate positive ROI.
- **Resource Allocation Is Uneven**: Current investments are spread across both high-return and loss-making areas, diluting profitability instead of scaling the strongest opportunities.

<br>

**✅ Strategic Recommendation**
To maximize overall profitability, leadership should:
- **Double Down on Proven Winners**: Scale up high-ROI sub-categories (Office Supplies like Labels, Paper, Envelopes; Technology products like Copiers and Phones) and strengthen profitable regions (West, East).
- **Restructure or Exit Value Destroyers**: Phase out or fundamentally rethink Furniture discounting, and review underperforming customer segments and regions to cut inefficiencies.
- **Stabilize Profitability**: Introduce tighter margin controls and operational oversight in volatile product lines (Copiers, Machines) and regions (Central, South) to smooth out performance swings.
- **Adopt Evidence-Based Discounting**: Move away from blanket discounting and shift to surgical, ROI-tested promotions, using A/B testing and controlled pilots to identify where discounts truly create incremental profit.

<br>

**🚀 Action Plan for Improving Profitability & Discount ROI**

**Short Term (0–3 months) — Quick Wins & Stabilization**
- **Stop Value-Destructive Discounts**: Immediately phase out discounting in Furniture (Tables, Bookcases) where ROI is consistently negative.
- **Tighten Margin Controls**: Implement stricter approval for high-discount transactions, especially in volatile categories (Technology Machines, Copiers).
- **Focus on High-ROI Discounts**: Prioritize Office Supplies (Labels, Paper, Envelopes) where discounts reliably generate profitable sales.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Deploy dashboards with automated alerts for loss-making products, regions, and customer segments to catch early warning signs.

<br>

**Mid Term (3–12 months) — Optimization & Strategic Focus**
- **Rebalance Product Portfolio**: Scale resources toward high-performing sub-categories (Copiers, Phones, Office Supplies) and reduce exposure to underperforming areas.
- **Regional & Segment Strategy**: Reassess sales coverage in Central and South regions; tailor strategies by customer segment (e.g., reposition Corporate and Home Office with revised pricing/offerings).
- **Evidence-Based Discounting**: Launch A/B testing pilots in Technology to measure the true incremental effect of discounts and identify profitable patterns.
- **Operational Stability**: Introduce predictive analytics (seasonality, demand spikes) to smooth volatility and better manage inventory, supply chain, and promotions.

<br>

**Long Term (12+ months) — Sustainable Growth & Transformation**
- **Value-Based Pricing Model**: Shift from discount-driven sales to value-based strategies (bundling, financing, loyalty programs, service add-ons).
- **Strategic Investment**: Double down in profitable regions (West, East) and high-margin product categories, while exploring potential exit/restructuring of chronically underperforming lines.
- **Cultural Shift**: Embed profitability accountability into KPIs for sales & regional managers, making discount ROI and profit margin core metrics for performance reviews.
- **Continuous Improvement Loop**: Institutionalize a quarterly review cycle where leadership evaluates discount ROI, product/region performance, and adjusts strategies dynamically.
